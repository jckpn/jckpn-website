                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer who loves to build things. I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science and Business Administration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about building products that people love. I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from web apps to mobile apps to games. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently looking for a software engineering internship for Summer 2022. If you're interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!
